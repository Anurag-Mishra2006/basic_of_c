1 .the memory layout of structure is often influenced by the alignment rules of the system


2. Padding  : to ensure the proper alignment of each member ,  complier oftern insert unused memory between structure memory.
            this unused memory is known as pddiing
            .padding help to ensure that each member of the structure is aligned acconding to the system rules


#include <stdio.h>

struct MyStruct {
    char a;     // 1 byte
    int b;      // 4 bytes
    char c;     // 1 byte
};

int main() {
    printf("Size of MyStruct: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(struct MyStruct));
    return 0;
}

in the above code there is the padding between a and b because b required 4 bytes of space to start at a memory address which is multiple of 4
