in c language following classes are most frequently used
    1. automatic variable
    2. external variable
    3. static variable
    4. register variable

1. automatic variable : auto storage class
            scope : local to function body they are defined  in
            default value : garbage value(a random value)
            lifetime : till the end of the function block they are defined in
        
        a variable defined without any storage class specification is by default an automatic variable
    

2. external variable : external storage class 
            they are same as global variable
            scope : global to the program they are defined in
            default value : 0
            lifetime : these variable are declare outside any function. They are available throughout the lifetime of the program 

            it is recommended to minimize the use of unnecessary global variables in a program 

3. static variable : static storage 
            scope : local to the block they are defined in 
            default intial value  : 0 
            lifetime : they are available throughout the lifetime of the program

        the space allocation of the static variable also happen in another segement of the storage class

4. register variable : register storage classs 
            scope : local to the function they are declared in
            default intial value : garbage value 
            lifetime : they are available till the end of the function block in the the variable is defined


        register variable requests the compiler to store the variable in the CPU register instead of storing in the memory to have faster acess

        generally this is done for the variable which are being used frequently
